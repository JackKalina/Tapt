CHART FILE SYNTAX
The first line in each file is the bpm, followed by the length. Then a space, then name, then artist, then album, then charter, and another space.
For example:

bpm
length

name
artist
album
charter


This is how the files are first loaded. This contains the bpm which is the basis for notes, etc. 
The bpm is multipled by the length (in s) to determine how many beats there are. 

Name, artist, album, and charter are all just basic information that the game displays. These are not used for any
chart data or visualization but they are used in the game. 

Each beat has four subdivisions and that is how data is loaded in. The file is read line-by-line by each 
quarter-division of a beat (I'm going to refer to them as QD from here on out becaue I don't feel like typing that whole thing.)
Each QD is a 1D 9-item array. Each index in the array (0-8) represents a key on the keyboard right to left.
In each index the data for any notes starting on that QD is stored. Here is the key:

Nothing: 0
Full beat (4 QD): 1
Half beat (2 QD): 2
Quarter beat (1 QD): 3
3/4 beat (3 QD): 4

These represent where the notes start. It is intentional for a QD to have a 1 and then three 0s after it. 

For example a line (QD) could look like:
[1,0,2,0,0,0,3,3,0]

Sustains are another thing and work in a bit of a weird way. To create a sustain you simply add an "s" to the end of the number.
The number gives you how long you have to hit the sustain initially. The s tells the game it is a sustain. To end the sustain
you place an "e" in the QD that you want the sustain to end on. If you have a sustain there should not be any notes
inside it (after the s and before the e). If you do that I don't like you and the game can't handle it (yet?).
